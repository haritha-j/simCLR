    "In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at self-supervised contrastive learning. Self-supervised learning, or also sometimes called unsupervised learning, describes the scenario where we have given input data, but no accompanying labels to train in a classical supervised way. However, this data still contains a lot of information from which we can learn: how are the images different from each other? What patterns are descriptive for certain images? Can we cluster the images? And so on. Methods for self-supervised learning try to learn as much as possible from the data alone, so it can quickly be finetuned for a specific classification task.\n",
    "The benefit of self-supervised learning is that a large dataset can often easily be obtained. For instance, if we want to train a vision model on semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, we can collect large amounts of data by simply installing a camera in a car, and driving through a city for an hour. In contrast, if we would want to do supervised learning, we would have to manually label all those images before training a model. This is extremely expensive, and would likely take a couple of months to manually label the same amount of data. Further, self-supervised learning can provide an alternative to transfer learning from models pretrained on ImageNet since we could pretrain a model on a specific dataset/situation, e.g. traffic scenarios for autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the last two years, a lot of new approaches have been proposed for self-supervised learning, in particular for images, that have resulted in great improvements over supervised models when few labels are available. The subfield that we will focus on in this tutorial is contrastive learning. Contrastive learning is motivated by the question mentioned above: how are images different from each other? Specifically, contrastive learning methods train a model to cluster an image and its slightly augmented version in latent space, while the distance to other images should be maximized. A very recent and simple method for this is [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029), which is visualized below (figure credit - [Ting Chen et al.](https://simclr.github.io/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"simclr_contrastive_learning.png\" width=\"500px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The general setup is that we are given a dataset of images without any labels, and want to train a model on this data such that it can quickly adapt to any image recognition task afterward. During each training iteration, we sample a batch of images as usual. For each image, we create two versions by applying data augmentation techniques like cropping, Gaussian noise, blurring, etc. An example of such is shown on the left with the image of the dog. We will go into the details and effects of the chosen augmentation techniques later. On those images, we apply a CNN like ResNet and obtain as output a 1D feature vector on which we apply a small MLP. The output features of the two augmented images are then trained to be close to each other, while all other images in that batch should be as different as possible. This way, the model has to learn to recognize the content of the image that remains unchanged under the data augmentations, such as objects which we usually care about in supervised tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we can look at the specific augmentations we want to apply. The choice of the data augmentation to use is the most crucial hyperparameter in SimCLR since it directly affects how the latent space is structured, and what patterns might be learned from the data. Let's first take a look at some of the most popular data augmentations (figure credit - [Ting Chen and Geoffrey Hinton](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/advancing-self-supervised-and-semi.html)):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "All of them can be used, but it turns out that two augmentations stand out in their importance: crop-and-resize, and color distortion. Interestingly, however, they only lead to strong performance if they have been used together as discussed by [Ting Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029) in their SimCLR paper. When performing randomly cropping and resizing, we can distinguish between two situations: (a) cropped image A provides a local view of cropped image B, or (b) cropped images C and D show neighboring views of the same image (figure credit - [Ting Chen and Geoffrey Hinton](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/advancing-self-supervised-and-semi.html)).\n",

    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"crop_views.svg\" width=\"400px\" style=\"padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "While situation (a) requires the model to learn some sort of scale invariance to make crops A and B similar in latent space, situation (b) is more challenging since the model needs to recognize an object beyond its limited view. However, without color distortion, there is a loophole that the model can exploit, namely that different crops of the same image usually look very similar in color space. Consider the picture of the dog above. Simply from the color of the fur and the green color tone of the background, you can reason that two patches belong to the same image without actually recognizing the dog in the picture. In this case, the model might end up focusing only on the color histograms of the images, and ignore other more generalizable features. If, however, we distort the colors in the two patches randomly and independently of each other, the model cannot rely on this simple feature anymore. Hence, by combining random cropping and color distortions, the model can only match two patches by learning generalizable representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, for our experiments, we apply a set of 5 transformations following the original SimCLR setup: random horizontal flip, crop-and-resize, color distortion, random grayscale, and gaussian blur. In comparison to the [original implementation](https://github.com/google-research/simclr), we reduce the effect of the color jitter slightly (0.5 instead of 0.8 for brightness, contrast, and saturation, and 0.1 instead of 0.2 for hue). In our experiments, this setting obtained better performance and was faster and more stable to train. If, for instance, the brightness scale highly varies in a dataset, the original settings can be more beneficial since the model can't rely on this information anymore to distinguish between images.\n"

However, the images have a higher resolution, namely $96\\times 96$ pixels, and we are only provided with 500 labeled images per class. Additionally, we have a much larger set of $100,000$ unlabeled images which are similar to the training images but are sampled from a wider range of animals and vehicles.

Both of these images are encoded into a one-dimensional feature vector, between which we want to maximize similarity which minimizes it to all other images in the batch. The encoder network is split into two parts: a base encoder network $f(\\cdot)$, and a projection head $g(\\cdot)$. The base network is usually a deep CNN as we have seen in e.g. [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html) before, and is responsible for extracting a representation vector from the augmented data examples. In our experiments, we will use the common ResNet-18 architecture as $f(\\cdot)$, and refer to the output as $f(\\tilde{x}_i)=h_i$. The projection head $g(\\cdot)$ maps the representation $h$ into a space where we apply the contrastive loss, i.e., compare similarities between vectors. It is often chosen to be a small MLP with non-linearities, and for simplicity, we follow the original SimCLR paper setup by defining it as a two-layer MLP with ReLU activation in the hidden layer. Note that in the follow-up paper, [SimCLRv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029), the authors mention that larger/wider MLPs can boost the performance considerably. This is why we apply an MLP with four times larger hidden dimensions, but deeper MLPs showed to overfit on the given dataset. The general setup is visualized below (figure credit - [Ting Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"simclr_network_setup.svg\" width=\"350px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After finishing the training with contrastive learning, we will remove the projection head $g(\\cdot)$, and use $f(\\cdot)$ as a pretrained feature extractor. The representations $z$ that come out of the projection head $g(\\cdot)$ have been shown to perform worse than those of the base network $f(\\cdot)$ when finetuning the network for a new task. This is likely because the representations $z$ are trained to become invariant to many features like the color that can be important for downstream tasks. Thus, $g(\\cdot)$ is only needed for the contrastive learning stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the architecture is described, let's take a closer look at how we train the model. As mentioned before, we want to maximize the similarity between the representations of the two augmented versions of the same image, i.e., $z_i$ and $z_j$ in the figure above, while minimizing it to all other examples in the batch. SimCLR thereby applies the InfoNCE loss, originally proposed by [Aaron van den Oord et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748) for contrastive learning. In short, the InfoNCE loss compares the similarity of $z_i$ and $z_j$ to the similarity of $z_i$ to any other representation in the batch by performing a softmax over the similarity values. The loss can be formally written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ell_{i,j}=-\\log \\frac{\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_i,z_j)/\\tau)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\\mathbb{1}_{[k\\neq i]}\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_i,z_k)/\\tau)}=-\\text{sim}(z_i,z_j)/\\tau+\\log\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\\mathbb{1}_{[k\\neq i]}\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_i,z_k)/\\tau)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $\\text{sim}$ is a similarity metric, and the hyperparameter $\\tau$ is called temperature determining how peaked the distribution is. Since many similarity metrics are bounded, the temperature parameter allows us to balance the influence of many dissimilar image patches versus one similar patch. The similarity metric that is used in SimCLR is cosine similarity, as defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{sim}(z_i,z_j) = \\frac{z_i^\\top \\cdot z_j}{||z_i||\\cdot||z_j||}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum cosine similarity possible is $1$, while the minimum is $-1$. In general, we will see that the features of two different images will converge to a cosine similarity around zero since the minimum, $-1$, would require $z_i$ and $z_j$ to be in the exact opposite direction in all feature dimensions, which does not allow for great flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, now that we have discussed all details, let's implement SimCLR below as a PyTorch Lightning module:\n"

    "After we have trained our model via contrastive learning, we can deploy it on downstream tasks and see how well it performs with little data. A common setup, which also verifies whether the model has learned generalized representations, is to perform Logistic Regression on the features. In other words, we learn a single, linear layer that maps the representations to a class prediction. Since the base network $f(\\cdot)$ is not changed during the training process, the model can only perform well if the representations of $h$ describe all features that might be necessary for the task. Further, we do not have to worry too much about overfitting since we have very few parameters that are trained. Hence, we might expect that the model can perform well even with very little data.\n",

    "First, let's implement a simple Logistic Regression setup for which we assume that the images already have been encoded in their feature vectors. If very little data is available, it might be beneficial to dynamically encode the images during training so that we can also apply data augmentations. However, the way we implement it here is much more efficient and can be trained within a few seconds. Further, using data augmentations did not show any significant gain in this simple setup.\n"

    "It is clear that the ResNet easily overfits on the training data since its parameter count is more than 1000 times larger than the dataset size. To make the comparison to the contrastive learning models fair, we apply data augmentations similar to the ones we used before: horizontal flip, crop-and-resize, grayscale, and gaussian blur. Color distortions as before are not used because the color distribution of an image showed to be an important feature for the classification. Hence, we observed no noticeable performance gains when adding color distortions to the set of augmentations. Similarly, we restrict the resizing operation before cropping to the max. 125% of its original resolution, instead of 1250% as done in SimCLR. This is because, for classification, the model needs to recognize the full object, while in contrastive learning, we only want to check whether two patches belong to the same image/object. Hence, the chosen augmentations below are overall weaker than in the contrastive learning case.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have discussed self-supervised contrastive learning and implemented SimCLR as an example method. We have applied it to the STL10 dataset and showed that it can learn generalizable representations that we can use to train simple classification models. With 500 images per label, it achieved an 8% higher accuracy than a similar model solely trained from supervision and performs on par with it when only using a tenth of the labeled data. Our experimental results are limited to a single dataset, but recent works such as [Ting Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029) showed similar trends for larger datasets like ImageNet. Besides the discussed hyperparameters, the size of the model seems to be important in contrastive learning as well. If a lot of unlabeled data is available, larger models can achieve much stronger results and come close to their supervised baselines. Further, there are also approaches for combining contrastive and supervised learning, leading to performance gains beyond supervision (see [Khosla et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362)). Moreover, contrastive learning is not the only approach to self-supervised learning that has come up in the last two years and showed great results. Other methods include distillation-based methods like [BYOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733) and redundancy reduction techniques like [Barlow Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230). There is a lot more to explore in the self-supervised domain, and more, impressive steps ahead are to be expected.\n",
